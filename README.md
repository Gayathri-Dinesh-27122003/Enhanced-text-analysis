Sentiment analysis, an essential component of natural language processing, is instrumental in unravelling the intricate tapestry of public sentiment and opinions spanning a myriad of subjects. In my project, I embark on a journey to conduct an exhaustive comparative analysis of four distinguished sentiment analysis models: VADER, XGBoost, RoBERTa, and BERT. The VADER model, rooted in a lexicon-based approach, relies on the Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner to assign sentiment scores to individual words and aggregate them into an overall sentiment score for the text. In contrast, the XGBoost model, a venerable gradient boosting algorithm, harnesses the power of various text features to classify sentiment. Meanwhile, RoBERTa and BERT, heralded as state-of-the-art transformer-based models, represent a quantum leap in sentiment analysis methodology. To conduct comparative analysis, I leveraged the IMDB movie reviews dataset, a gold standard in sentiment analysis research renowned for its diversity and relevance. Through meticulous experimentation and evaluation on this dataset, we subject each model to rigorous scrutiny across a spectrum of key metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Moreover, we delve deep into the computational efficiency and resource requirements of each model, providing valuable insights into their practical feasibility for real-world sentiment analysis applications. By elucidating the performance characteristics and practical considerations of these models, we empower researchers and practitioners to make informed decisions when navigating the complex landscape of sentiment analysis methodologies across diverse domains. Our findings transcend mere performance metrics, offering nuanced perspectives on the strengths and weaknesses of each model.
